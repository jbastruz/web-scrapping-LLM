# Information Watch on the Internet using Mistral.AI

This notebook is an essay on the use of Mistral.AI for an information watch on the internet.
The goal is to retrieve articles from the internet and make a summary using `mistral.ai`, then send them by email in HTML format generated by `Mistral.ai`

The code is divided into 3 parts:

1. Article retrieval via URL with `BeautifulSoup`
2. Summary generation with `Mistral.AI`
3. HTML content generation for sending automated email via `Mistral.AI`
4. Sending the email message

We will detail the code step by step in the rest of the notebook.

## Loading Packages
The necessary libraries to be loaded are:

* requests
* bs4
* mistralai
* smtplib

```bash
pip install requests bs4 mistralai smtplib
```

You can load these libraries in Python using the following code:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import mistralai
import smtplib
```
This will allow you to use the functions and classes provided by these libraries in your code.

## Email Sending

This program is an example of the use of Mistral.AI, it is possible to use it for other projects. It is possible to retrieve text from another source, and thus work on a different type of information. It will be necessary to think about how to extract the data, which may be different from one site to another.
